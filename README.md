# ivis Artist Map

This is the prototype to present at the end of the ivis lecture. We are trying to visualize the places where certain artists have been exhibited. 

## Running the prototype

Start a webserver in the root of this repository and then navigate to /index.html

For example, you can start this from the intelliJ IDE, like always.
