# ivis Artist Map

This is the prototype to present at the end of the ivis lecture. We are trying to visualize the places where certain artists have been exhibited.

## Running the prototype

Start a webserver in the root of this repository and then navigate to /index.html

For example, you can start this from the intelliJ IDE, like always.

## What is where?

All the CSS that should be edited is now in /css. The timeline-specific CSS files are in /lib/timeline, because the timeline javascript automatically loads them from there.

Javascript libraries are in /lib. Some are in subfolders, some not. It didn't make sense to create a subfolder for just one file for JQuery.

The image files for timeline are also in /lib/timeline/img
